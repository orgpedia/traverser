# Use cases for traverser

This document contains how the traverser will be used to download
documents from government 

Need to think of not just the scenario of one-time download, but also
repeated download to keep things in sync.


Some sites have two sections current and archive, with the documents
moved from current to archive. In this case these current section would
be checked on a schedule while the archive won't be checked.
